_Léon - The URL Cleaner_ is an Android application which removes tracking and other obsolete
parameters from a URL before sharing. Its usage is simple, integrating into Android's standard
sharing mechanism. Léon runs on Android 5.0 and later, is open source and does not contain any
tracking or advertising frameworks. Léon does not collect any data about you.

The benefits of removing tracking parameters are:

* Protects your and the recipient's privacy
* Improves readability of links
* Saves characters (in Tweets for example)

## How to use

When sharing a link, select _URL Cleaner_ as the receiving application. Then from within _URL
Cleaner_ share the cleaned URL to the actual target application.
